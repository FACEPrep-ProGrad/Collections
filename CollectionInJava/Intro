Collections -> Framework which has a collection of interfaces and classes

List -> ArrayList & LinkedList

Set -> HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet

Map -> HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap

data structure -> arranging or organizing data in a particular manner

List -> Ordered Collection or sequence -> contain duplicate elements

ArrayList -> Implements List Interface -> underlying data structure is array

add(Object o)

add(int index, Object o)

remove(Object 0)

remove(int index)

set(int index, Object o)

size()

Iterator -> hasNext() -> Check whether we have element in list or not, next() -> fetch the 
first element and move the cursor to the next element


Set -> Doesn't allow duplicates

HashSet -> Underlying datastructure is HashTable. -> Unordered

LinkedHashSet -> Underlying datastructure is Hashtable with linked list running through it
-> Insertion-order

TreeSet -> SortedOrder -> underlying datastructure is red-black tree
